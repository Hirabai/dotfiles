About a month of me learning how to work in the shell.

I could have just copied someone else's dotfile repo and be done with it, but I want to understand the underlying system, and this personal repo is meant to be a "from scratch" process.

So far "The Linux Command line" by William E. Shotts Jr has been of immense value in learning how to become a shell guru.

Is that going to be useful in the next 5 to 10 years?

When everything is moving towards AI?

Does it matter?

All I know is that the tools and how you use them are two different things.

My approach to this overall has been more to understand than to become extremely honed.

Sometimes your brain is able to make better more clearer connections after learning things that seem irrelevant to our standards

But those connections are how we find opportunities and engage with the world

Using real intelligence for something more than what we're given
